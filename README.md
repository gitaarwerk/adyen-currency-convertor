# Adyen currency convertor

## Plan of attack
First initial steps is to create this document to show the start of the project. It gives some guidelines and decision making before I start working on this. This document will change in time. See it as a living document :-) 

I will start the 4 hour timer as an outline for the assignment. I will not include the design and bootstrapping of the React / Redux, as this is not a daily task for me, so it will may consume a little more time than needed.

## Steps
1. The initial NPX react-bootstrapping.
2. Adding the redux-store to it.
3. Upload the design sketch.
4. Create the minimal thing you can make (getting the data, and just convert USD to EUR). 
5. Add more functionality to create what the app needs to do.
6. Change design to something more likable.
7. Go from mobile design to desktop design.
7. Polish the design/code.
8. Hand in.


## Way of working
Not entirely sure how to approach this yet, but I think I will start mobile first, and test driven. As tests are capable of spotting rounding issues when I may choose the wrong route to go, it would be easier to spot and adjust, as this is the core of the application.

I may go TypeScript, but since I have not yet the most experience here, I may do this with PropTypes for now. TypeScript may cost me too much time.
